faster path algorithm
-hdeg by hdeg find out all paths between all critical cells at once. Do this with higher memory usage. 
Find out all paths to from critical cells to all cells and use this to limit the number of times next step up/down is called
-consider concatenating braid/enh_words when calculating next step up/down and prefersback




on path and cell analysis, divide the paths into sets/dicts/arrays of (start_vertex,end_vertex,first_L) and find out a way to print them



get statistics while running:
python3 -m cProfile -s time braidalgo.py abcabcabcabcabcabc

interesting braid?
